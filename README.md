# ðŸ“„ ACCESS: AI-Curated Comprehensive Evidence Search System

ACCESS is a platform that helps researchers discover and access disability science literature and datasets. The system integrates large language model capabilities with a comprehensive knowledge base built on semantic web technologies, allowing researchers to ask natural language questions like "What longitudinal datasets exist for studying employment outcomes among college graduates with physical disabilities?" and receive comprehensive, cited responses with direct links to relevant datasets without requiring direct data manipulation. By combining retrieval-augmented generation architecture with expert-validated content from sources like ACS, CDC, ADDEP, and NSHD datasets, the platform serves as an intelligent intermediary that understands nuanced research queries and provides contextual recommendations. The AI assistant eliminates the traditional barriers of complex database navigation by offering intelligent query suggestions, automated literature review assistance, and research gap identification, fundamentally transforming disability science research accessibility.
